This workshop introduces the application of MDTraj to the analysis of protein simulation data

It is in two parts:

1. INTRODUCTION
An introduction to the use of MDTraj for the analysis of simulations. The data comes from the associated 'protein simulation with amber and openmm' workshop.

2. EQUILIBRATION
An introduction to a key issue in MD simulation: testing for equilibration, samopling, and convergence. The data here comes from a long simulation of a different protein, chignolin.
