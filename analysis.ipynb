    "## 4. RMSD analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question in any MD analysis is nearly always \"how much has the structure changed over the simulation from where it started?\". The most common metric for this is the **root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)**. It is a pair-wise metric (i.e., a measure of the difference between two conformations of the same system), has a value of zero if the two conformations are identical, and gets larger as they get more different in shape. Its units are the same as the units of the coordinates - so for `MDTraj`, they will be *nanometers*. The value of the RMSD also depends on which atoms of the two systems are included in the analysis (you might choose all protein atoms, or maybe just protein heavy atoms, or maybe just backbone atoms, or maybe just C-alpha atoms). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the RMSD of each snapshot in the production simulation from the reference (starting) structure, considering all protein atoms in the analysis. This used `MDTraj`'s [`.rmsd` method](https://www.mdtraj.org/1.9.8.dev0/api/generated/mdtraj.rmsd.html#mdtraj.rmsd). We will then plot the results using `matplotlib`:"
